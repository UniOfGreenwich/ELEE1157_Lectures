## Module Aims

To develop [your] knowledge of the protocols used in both large organizations and in internetworking; to enable [you] to appreciate the issues that need to be addressed in the development and management of a large computer network system; to equip [you] with practical router-configuration skills and use appropriate tools to analyse networking protocols and knowledge to design and implement the repair; to allow for critical reflection upon the technologies used in LANs and their social consequences.

## Module Learning Outcomes 

On successful completion of this module a student will be able to:

[1] Create policies for and configure appropriate routing protocols in a large network. 

[2] Analyse and solve problems involving the applications and configuration of hardware and software components of a communications network. 

[3] Compare and contrast in practical design and implementation of LANs within given parameters and have the ability to choose the appropriate technology for a given situation. 

[4] Apply diagnostic tools and configure a network to specific design specifications to support a wide range of networked environments.
